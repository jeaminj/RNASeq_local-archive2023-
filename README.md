# RNASeq_local
Scripts for running rnaseq workflow locally without cloud or high performance computing

These scripts serve as a demonstration for a workflow that could be performed on the cloud or HPC environment with some modifications (resource requests, job steps). The data and analysis produced from this workflow may be useful in pilot studies, where analysis is needed on an experiment before more expenses and resources are devoted towards continuing the investigation

Note: STAR cannot locally be used for alignment without significant more storage and memory than below
